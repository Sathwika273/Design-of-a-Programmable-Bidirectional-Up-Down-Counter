# Design-of-a-Programmable-Bidirectional-Up-Down-Counter
Designed and implemented a configurable up-down counter with programmable upper/lower limits, preload register, and cycle count control. Integrated memory-mapped read/write interface, error detection logic, direction control, and end-of-cycle flag generation. Verified functional correctness through SystemVerilog-based testbench.
